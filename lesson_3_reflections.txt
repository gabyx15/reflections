When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You could use it for backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Perhaps you'll want to have the changes made by other user.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

I would use forks when somebody else created the repository. Clone, when I need to make a modification to that repository and branches when I'm going to work in a different aspect of the project (for example a new feature).
