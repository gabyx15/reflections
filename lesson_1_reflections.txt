How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because it is easier to see a difference if you have the two parts right next to each other rather than among other things.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see how the proyect has evolved and improved. Also, you can reviewed the changes you have made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You get to decide when to commit. You evaluate if it is really necessary to commit.
    Cons: If you forget to commit you will lose the exact point where you made the change.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Becuase the files are all related.
